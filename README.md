# redux-thunk-login
Redux application that uses redux-thunk for async requests. This application simulates how a user is authenticated or not from logging in. 

To test functionality you will need to go into the action creator to see the current user admin email and password. From there you can run the app and try logging in with that admin info or as a non-user and see the errors. 

This application was created for practice of async requests with redux-thunk.
